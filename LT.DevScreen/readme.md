## One Hundred Prisoners Problem

Your goal is to program a simulation of the `One Hundred Prisoners` problem using the optimal strategy.
You do not have to design the optimal strategy yourself.
That work is already done for you.
Watch the first 4 minutes of this video for a clear 
explanation of the problem and the optimal strategy:

The remainder of the video details how the solution works,
but is not necessary viewing to be able to program the simulation.

More information can be found at Wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem

Edit [OneHunderPrisoners.cs](OneHunderPrisoners.cs) by implementing the `RunSimulation()` method.

Once the simulation is correctly programmed, 
the test defined in [OneHundredPrisonersTests.cs](OneHundredPrisonersTests.cs) will pass.
